Description: BRSS Offline RSS Reader version 0.1
        -----------------------------------
        
        BRSS is a so-called 'offline' RSS readerheavily inspired by Naufrago!
        
        BRSS consists of two applications:
        
        1- ENGINE.
        The BRSS engine runs in the background and publishes it's methods through
        DBus. The engine downloads feed articles into a SQLite database and 
        downloads remote images in a specified directories. 
        When an article is requested, the engine transparently replaces all remote 
        images' 'src' attributes with the local path.
        The engine polls feeds at a configurable interval, and can import 
        (and export) OPML files.
        
        2- FRONTEND
        BRSS also comes with a Gtk frontend that connects to a running engine, to 
        show feeds and articles previously downloaded.
